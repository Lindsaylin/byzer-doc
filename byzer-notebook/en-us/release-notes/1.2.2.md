# Byzer Notebook 1.2.2 Release Announcement

Publish Date：`2022-08-10`

It's a pleasure to announce that we just updated Byzer Notebook to the latest version ：Byzer Notebook 1.2.2.

Byzer Notebook is an open-source web interactive computing (Web IDE) application platform based on the Byzer engine. Byzer Notebook provides a unified platform and language for business analysts, data scientists, and IT engineers to write and run code interactively, enabling users to bridge complex data links and achieve low-cost data analysis and AI landing.

### Major Changes

1. Optimize IM scheduling message notification display

In the 1.2.1 version of Byzer Notebook, we added the function that the scheduling execution result can be notified through IM robot (Feishu, Enterprise Wechat, etc.). In Byzer Notebook 1.2.2, we have optimized the content of the display information:

- Add a new field `notebook_name` to locate the notebook that executes the scheduling task.

- Change the `Execute User` information to the user name that publishes the scheduling task instead of ByzerRobot.
